## How To Start

Run:
### The terraform init command initializes a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. This is the first command that should be run after writing a new Terraform configuration or cloning an existing one from version control. It is safe to run this command multiple times.
```
terraform init
```
### The terraform plan command creates an execution plan, which lets you preview the changes that Terraform plans to make to your infrastructure.
```
terraform plan 
```

### The terraform apply command executes the actions proposed in a Terraform plan.
```
terraform apply
```
